# SeniorDesignCode
Senior Design code for our 'Sail to win' project, this is the foundational software that will house within the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB of RAM. And it is going to parse through an endpoint and then give back out some kind of output

# How to operate:
Assuming you are using a Raspberry Pi, you will want to have SignalK already installed with OpenPlotter, go to the directory where you have placed the script and using Raspberry pi's OS click on 'Tools', and then Open terminal within current folder.
Doing so will open the terminal within the current path directory. Afterwards assuming you installed python already, you can check the version of python with 'python --version' syntax, install the dependencies that are involved for the code.
- pip install aiohttp
after the dependencies are installed you can run the script with 'python Script.py' within the current terminal opened.
